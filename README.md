# Huddle-Landing-Page
Project Description.

This project showcased my basic skills on HTML and CSS, it was among the challenges I accepted from frotend mentor.
The target of this challenge is to design a Huddle Landing Page for three distinct type.
1. Desktop viewers it has a width of 1440px (given from the mentor).
2. Mobile viewers this one has a width of 37.5vw, this is for those who are having mobile phones to be able to access it.
3. Active status this is the same with Desktop view designed but a little different, it has one CSS attribute that differenciate it with the first one. That attribute was Hover effect (Use to reflect an assigned color when click to show its active.)

The project was designed as recommended and it met all the requirements, it has two background effects, the first is the background color and followed by background Image for all the files. It has header, content, and footer across all the files.
